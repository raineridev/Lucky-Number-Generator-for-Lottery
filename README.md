# Lucky Number Generator for Lottery ü§ûüçÄ

This extremely small project aims to create a certain combination of lucky numbers to be played in the lottery, letting a computer do this is much better than taking numbers out of its own head, the project also counts with each startup it generates a new file of text.
## Run

To start the generator just type the command:
```bash
  node lucky.js
```


## Future Updates

- Interactive Panel, Graphical User Interface(GUI)
- Suit for different country lotteries
- Check if you really were the winner
- Analyze previous lotteries through the Interactive Panel


## Usage/Examples

```javascript
    lot(60) //Inside the function has the maximum number value to be generated
```


## Screenshots
Result of the command, as already explained it creates a text file.
